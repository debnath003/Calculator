# Calculator

This is a task to make a simple calculator using only HTML5 and CSS3. This calculator can do addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and modulo operation. The "eval= " attribute in <input> tag helps us to evaluate any calculation of any given operator.

Do note there is no additional Js file as all the work is done in the HTML file only. CSS file is needed for customization of the webpages. Also, I used Bootstrap for a Navigation bar, and also to give a webpage a good look. :)
